This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks.

For a\n * numeric axis, these will simply be numbers. For a date axis, these will be\n * millis since epoch (convertable to Date objects using \"new Date(a)\" and \"new\n * Date(b)\").\n *\n * opts provides access to chart- and axis-specific options. It can be used to\n * access number/date formatting code/options, check for a log scale, etc.\n *\n * pixels is the length of the axis in pixels. opts('pixelsPerLabel') is the\n * minimum amount of space to be allotted to each label. For instance, if\n * pixels=400 and opts('pixelsPerLabel')=40 then the ticker should return\n * between zero and ten (400/40) ticks.\n *\n * dygraph is the Dygraph object for which an axis is being constructed.\n *\n * forced_values is used for secondary y-axes. The tick positions are typically\n * set by the primary y-axis, so the secondary y-axis has no choice in where to\n * put these. It simply has to generate labels for these data values.\n *\n * Tick lists\n * ----------\n * Typically a tick will have both a grid/tick line and a label at one end of\n * that line (at the bottom for an x-axis, at left or right for the y-axis).\n *\n * A tick may be missing one of these two components:\n * - If \"label_v\" is specified instead of \"v\", then there will be no tick or\n *   gridline, just a label.\n * - Similarly, if \"label\" is not specified, then there will be a gridline\n *   without a label.\n *\n * This flexibility is useful in a few situations:\n * - For log scales, some of the tick lines may be too close to all have labels.\n * - For date scales where years are being displayed, it is desirable to display\n *   tick marks at the beginnings of years but labels (e.g. \"2006\") in the\n *   middle of the years.\n */\n\n/*jshint sub:true */\n/*global Dygraph:false */\n(function() {\n\"use strict\";\n\n/** @typedef {Array.<{v:number, label:string, label_v:(string|undefined)}>} */\nDygraph.TickList = undefined;
